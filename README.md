<summary> Tutorial </summary>

Install necessary package using

```console
$ pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Decompress data just after cloning this repo
1. CMU original dataset 
```console
$ cd data/ && tar -xvzf *.tar.gz
```

1. TMDB 
```console
$ cd external && unzip movies.zip && mv "Movies Dataset" Movies
```

Or simply decompress archive from file system. You can also directly use the pre-processed pickle file in `data/Processed`

## Abstract 📌

<span align="justify">
In this data analysis, we will study how women are represented in movies, why, and what the impact of their presence is. To do so, we will use the ratio of actors and actresses as the main metric. We will analyze the quality of the feminine characters in movies, such as whether they have a name. Furthermore, we will try to understand the cause of the over- or sub-representation of women characters, and the effect it has on the story.
To do so, we will use the movies contained in the CMU Summary corpus, along with the genders of the movies' crews scrapped from Wikidata and the roles of the characters taken from TMDB.
In order to complete our quality evalutation of the representation of women, we will use the results of the Bechdel test, which evaluates the importance of the feminine characters in a movie.
This study aims to provide a comprehensive analysis of female representation in cinema, using a data-driven approach to evaluate how gender dynamics in movies influence both narrative quality and societal perceptions.

## Research Questions 🔍
We consider that women's representation in media such as movies is crutial for advances in feminist struggles, because being able to relate on fictional characters is essential because it allows us to explore and understand complex human experiences and emotions in a safe and imaginative context.
Analyzing the representation of women in movies through various datasets, including cast members genders, movie success, and Bechdel test results, provides a comprehensive understanding of gender representation in the film industry; in cast and crew members as well as in the movies stories.

Our journey through the cinematic universe is guided by the following pivotal questions:

- How does women in important positions in movies influence the proportion of actresses in a movie, as well as the representation of women through the Bechdel test.
- How does the representation of women, both in front of the camera and behind the scenes, shape a film's reception and resonance with its audience?
- Which genres in cinema represent more women?

## Datasets 📊

In this analysis, we will use three different datasets

- The original and provided [CMU](http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~ark/personas/) dataset.
- The [TMDB Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/rounakbanik/the-movies-dataset): this dataset offers metadata for over 45,000 movies, with a particular focus on user ratings. Our primary interest lies in getting the populariy, the number of votes each movie receives and its average score rating to define a success metric. This dataset also includes valuable details about a movie's crew, such as the gender of the director and producers. These data points are crucial for conducting analyses on women's roles behind the camera.
- The [Bechdel Dataset](https://bechdeltest.com) that contains the Bechdel rating score for more than 10'000 movies. This dataset will be used to conduct a analysis on movies that passes (or not) the Bechdel test.
- The [May 2022 National Occupational Employment and Wage Estimates](https://www.bls.gov/oes/current/oes_nat.htm). This dataset is used in the analysis of the social status of roles played by actors.
## Methods 💡

### **Step 1**: Preprocessing on data

<span align="justify"> 

**Original Dataset**: Initial cleaning has been conducted.

**Bechdel Dataset**: The Bechdel dataset boasts the advantage of minimal missing values, which simplifies the cleaning process significantly.

**TMDB Dataset**: Our focus with the TMDB dataset is to extract data on the crew members behind the scenes, particularly their gender. We mitigate the impact of missing values by employing the genderguesser package, which allows us to infer genders from first names and reduce the volume of incomplete data.

### **Step 2**: Exploring the data

<span align="justify"> 
  
**Actors, directors and producers**: We looked at the evolution of the main roles in the movies: actor, director and producer, and look for correlations.
**Genres**: We looked at the proportions of actors ans actresses in different genres of movies.

### **Step 3**: Quality evaluation of the representation of women

We analyzed whether there is an evolution in the quality of the representation of women through different angles:
- Actors age: To see whether the age of an actor playsing in a movie depends on their gender.
- Characters roles: To see whether there is a predominance of roles for women and men.
- The Bechdel Test: Tool to qualify the movies through their representation of women.
- Popularity, box-office revenue and rating of movies: Metrics used to evaluate the success of a movie
