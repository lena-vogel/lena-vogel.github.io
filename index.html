                        Through the feminist struggles and the recent advances in gender equality, women have gained
                        space and
                        importance in movies.
                        <br>Indeed, the cinematic world has long been a mirror reflecting societal norms and changes,
                        and nowhere is
                        this more evident than in the representation of women.</br>
                        <br> In the hallowed halls of the <a href="https://www.festival-cannes.com/selection/">Cannes
                            Film
                            Festival</a>, a prestigious battleground for cinematic
                        excellence, the winds of change are palpable. This year, a striking 7 out of 21 films competing
                        for the top
                        prize are helmed by women. Cast your mind back to 1995, and the contrast is stark: a mere 2 out
                        of 24. This
                        shift is more than just numbers; it's a testament to the slow but sure march towards gender
                        parity in
                        filmmaking.
                        <br> <br>
                        Moreover, it is easy to see that movies, TV shows and other forms of art talk more and more
                        about women
                        realities, letting the archaic male-gaze in the past. However, like any great story, this one
                        too has its
                        conflicts. Stereotypes and inequalities stubbornly persist in the industry, reminding us that
                        our quest for
                        true equality is not over.</br>
                        <br>Let's embark on a journey of discovery together. In this study, we'll delve into the
                        gendered dynamics
                        at play in the film industry. Our guide? The CMU Movie Corpus dataset, a dataset of around
                        80,000
                        movies released between 1914 and 2012. To start, let us show you a first insight on the dataset
                        we are working with, look at the graph below which tracks the evolution of movie releases through 
                        the years.</br>

                        <iframe src="plots/movie_distribution.html" width="100%" height="600"
                            style="border:none;"></iframe>
                        <br>See? There are very few movies before 1980, this is why for the visual simplicity of future 
                        graphs which represent values per year, we will restrain the years range to the 30 years between 
                        1980 and 2010 only.</br>
                        <br>First, we could ask ourselves the following question: "Are there more women actresses who
                        play
                        characters in movies now than before?"</br>

                        <iframe src="plots/actors_gender_proportion.html" width="100%" height="600"
                            style="border:none;"></iframe>
                        <br>That is interesting! From 1980 to 2010, the proportion of women actresses compared to men
                        increased of
                        more than 7%! It is not a huge increase, but it still is considerable.
                        We'll have to investigate more on that and the potential causes for this increase, as well as
                        whether when
                        women are <b>more</b> represented, it also imply they are <b>better</b> represented or not.</br>

        <div class="container">
            <div class="row tm-content-box">
                <div class="col-lg-12 col-xl-12">

                        Now, let us explore the potential causes for the increase of women actresses in movies. Here, we
                        will only take the data on the movies we have access to.
                        We will not be correlating the growing number of actresses to historical events
                        whatsoever.<br />
                        The first thing that should come into your mind is: "What about the movie directors and
                        producers?" Lucky you, the next graphs are about the gender proportions of the latter.<br />
                        <iframe src="plots/gender_distribution_bar.html" width="100%" height="600"
                            style="border:none;"></iframe>
                        <br />
                        It is quite crazy to see such a low propotion of female directors, it is even lower than the percentage
                        of producers! So let's see how this proportion evolved through the years.<br />

                        <iframe src="plots/director_gender_proportion.html" width="100%" height="600"
                            style="border:none;"></iframe>
                        <br />
                        It looks like it almost did not change at all! But what about the producers?<br />

                        <iframe src="plots/producer_gender_proportion.html" width="100%" height="600"
                            style="border:none;"></iframe>
                        <br />
                        Well well well, we should have kept our excpectations low, because it is the same story here!
                        So let's see if, despite the small number of directors and producers, there is a correlation 
                        with the proportion of actresses.<br />
                      
                        <iframe src="plots/director_producer_actor_gender_correlation.html" width="100%" height="550"
                            style="border:none;"></iframe>
                        Despite the last sad discoveries, here it seems like there is a correlation between the proportion of actresses and the involvement
                        of a female director or a female producer. When both director and producer are women, it seems like the proportion of actresses is even higher.

                        Now is time to evaluate the quality of this encouraging involvement of women in the film
                        industry!<br /><br />
                        <h3>Actors age</h3>
                        First, we will look at the evolution of the age of male and female actors. Why? Simply because
                        young women are generally prefered than old women, while we are supposed to appreciate men at
                        every age.<br />


                        <iframe src="plots/age_evolution_plot.html" width="100%" height="600"
                            style="border:none;"></iframe>
                        Well well well... It seems pretty clear that there is no evolution among the years, but that the
                        difference between genders stays tremendously stable!<br /><br />

                        <h3>Actors roles</h3>
                        We want to plot the main roles of the characters in wordclouds: one for the men and one for the
                        women characters.<br />
                        Please note that most of the characters collected in the dataset are only mentioned by name, and not by
                        role. Thus, we will only plot the roles of the characters that have a role. In a wordcloud, the most
                        mentionned roles are represented by a bigger size.<br />
                        <br />

                        <div style="display: flex; justify-content: center; align-items: center; height: 100%;">
                            <img src="plots/wordcloud_job_roles.png" width="70%" height="100%"
                                style="border:none;"></img>
                        </div><br />

                        Looking at these wordclouds, it seems quite clear that women mostly are designated as family members, 
                        while men mainly are designated by their job position.
                        And now, we want to plot the roles related to other roles (for
                        instance: in "Mother's girlfriend", we will represent "Girlfriend")<br />
                        <br />

                        <div style="display: flex; justify-content: center; align-items: center; height: 100%;">
                            <img src="plots/wordcloud_r2j_roles.png" width="70%" height="100%"
                                style="border:none;"></img>
                        </div><br />
                        Here, the data are more chaotic, so there is not much to say, appart from the fact that there is 
                        again a predominance of family members in women, while men have job positions.
                        We can also notice that <br /><br />

                        <h2 class="tm-text-primary mb-4 tm-section-title">Bechdel Test</h2>
                        <div class="container-bd" style="display: flex; align-items: flex-start;">
                            <div class="text" style=" width: 50%; margin-right: 20px;">
                                <p>Have you ever heard of the Bechdel Test? It's a set of criteria that a film must meet
                                    to be
                                    considered minimally adequate in representing women. Popularized by Alison Bechdel
                                    back in 1985 (the original
                                    illustration is shown on the right),
                                    the test is incredibly simple:</p>

                                <ol>
                                    <li>There must be at least two named women in the film;</li>
                                    <li>They must talk to each other;</li>
                                    <li>About something other than a man.</li>
                                </ol>

                                <p>Sounds easy, right? In an ideal world, every film would effortlessly pass this test.
                                    Yet, the
                                    reality is a bit more complex...</p>

                                <p>We've managed to gather Bechdel Score data for 2,658 films, thanks to the API from
                                  the <a href="https://bechdeltest.com/">Bechdel Test website</a>. It is important to note
                                  that anyone can enter data on whether a film passes the Bechdel Test or not, on a scale to 0 to 3.
                                  The lingering question remains: Has the Bechdel Test influenced the
                                    audience's
                                    perception and the representation of women in the film industry?</p>

                            Imagine how different the cinematic landscape could be if more films met these criteria.
                            What do
                            you think? Do films that pass the Bechdel Test tend to resonate more with audiences, or is
                            the
                            impact more subtle, perhaps reflected in the gradual evolution of female roles in cinema?
                            Let's
                            delve into this intriguing topic together.</p>

                        However, we need to be careful with those data, because not all movies from the CMU Dataset have
                        been evaluated by the Bechdel test. We should also consider that there is a bias on the set of
                        movies that were entered by hand in this Bechdel dataset.<br />
                        <iframe src="plots/number_of_movies_bechdel.html" width="100%" height="600"
                            style="border:none;"></iframe>
                        As one can see, only between 16 and 140 movies were evaluated per year, which is a very small
                        number compared to the total number of movies released per year (between 1980 and 2010). Let's
                        start this analysis, by looking at the evolution of the Bechdel rating through the years.<br />

                        <iframe src="plots/bd_rating_evolution.html" width="100%" height="600" style="border:none;"></iframe>         -->

                        And do you think that movies with higher Bechdel rating involve more women ? <br />

                        <iframe src="plots/actors_bdrating_proportion.html" width="100%" height="600"
                            style="border:none;"></iframe>

                        <p>
                            It is obvious that a higher Bechdel rating typically indicates a greater representation of
                            women (>20% increase for movies which completely pass the Bechdel test compared to the ones
                            that do not), this is a result we could reasonabily have expected, considering the test's
                            inherent design. So movies with higher number of actress tends
                            to have
                            a higher Bechdel rating. But does this better rating influences the impact on the audience?
                            Here, we'll take 2 metrics: the popularity of the movie, and the rating of the movie.
                        </p>


                        <iframe src="plots/popularity.html" width="100%" height="600" style="border:none;"></iframe>

                        <p>
                            There's an intriguing pattern in these glitzy displays: movies that only score 1 at the
                            Bechdel test are often the most popular onesy. Why is
                            this so? The answers aren't straightforward. This could be multiple confounder into this
                            complex
                            tapestry. It could be that the film
                            industry, with its influential might, chooses to shine a brighter spotlight on movies where
                            male characters take the center stage, and where women only are... present. 
                            Or perhaps, the audience, like a river, naturally flows towards the stories
                            echoing a significant male
                            presence. So is it the chicken or the egg?
                            Let's see if we can find any pattern between the percentage of actresses and the rating:
                        </p>
                        <iframe src="plots/regression_actresses_rating.html" width="100%" height="600" style="border:none;"></iframe>
                        There is a very small correlation between the percentage of actresses and the rating, but it is
                        not significant.

                        <div class="image" style="width: 60%;">
                            <img style="max-width: 100%; height: auto; display:block"
                                src="plots/corr_matrix.png" alt="Correlation matrix">
                        </div>

                        <p>
                            The biggest correlation among the ones we covered is the correlation between the popularity
                            and the box-office revenue, which is quite an obvious correlation: the more people like the 
                            movie, the more they pay and go to the cinema to watch it! The Bechdel rating, however,
                            does not show great correlation, but in general, the higher the Bechdel rating, the lower the
                            box-office revenue, the popularity and the vote average.<br /><br />

                            But wait, there's another twist in the tale. Could it be that men and women don't often
                            share the same cinematic playground, creating a division in movie genres, where some genres
                            naturally attract more fame and followers?
                        </p><br />

                        <h3>Movie Genres</h3>
                        <iframe src="plots/bd_genre_ds.html" width="100%" height="600" style="border:none;"></iframe>

                        <p>
                            As you can see, the distribution of male and female actors varies significantly across movie
                            genres. Female
                            actors are more frequently seen in LGBT, Drama, and Romance films, whereas they are less
                            prevalent in Action or Crime movies. How could we make this irrelevant... ?
                        </p>
                        <br>
                        <h3> A friend to the rescue: Matching</h3>

                        <br>
                        <p>
                            Have you ever heard about Matching ? It's a relatively new concept in statistics,
                            popularized by Donald Rubin in the 1980s. You can think of Matching as your trusty sidekick
                            in reducing bias when estimating treatment effects in observational studies. Here's the
                            challenge: for every treated unit in your study, you need to find one or more non-treated
                            units. But not just any units will do. These counterparts must be similar in observable
                            characteristics, creating a perfect balance against which the covariates are evenly matched.
                            <br><br>
                            Here, we will perform exact one-to-one matching, based on the main genre of the movie.
                            By comparing movies within these genre-matched pairs, we can more accurately assess the
                            impact of genre on both Bechdel Ratings and audience popularity. This controlled comparison
                            helps isolate the variable of genre, allowing for a clearer understanding of its role. We will have two groups
                            <ul>
                                <li>
                                    <b>Treatment Group</b>: Movies from a genre that typically scores high on the Bechdel test.
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                    <b>Control Group</b>: Movies from a genre that typically scores low on the Bechdel test.
                                </li>
                            </ul>

                            Doing this on our dataset, we get 880 pairs of matched movies! Let's see what we can learn from this.
                            We want to know if the Bechdel rating plays a role in the popularity of a movie. So, let's try to estimate the following 
                            linear regression
                        </p>
