                            </h2>
                            Through the feminist struggles and the recent advances in gender equality, women have gained
                            space and
                            importance in movies.
                            <br>Indeed, the cinema industry has long been a mirror reflecting societal norms and
                            changes,
                            and this is especially relevant for the representation of women.</br>
                            <br> Looking at the <a
                                href="https://www.festival-cannes.com/selection/">Cannes
                                Film
                                Festival</a>, a prestigious sphere for cinematic
                            excellence, change is palpable. This year, a striking 7 out of 21 films
                            competing
                            for the top
                            prize are helmed by women (1/3). Cast your mind back to 1995, and the contrast is stark: a
                            mere 2
                            out
                            of 24 (1/12). This
                            shift is more than just numbers; it's a testament to the slow but sure march towards gender
                            parity in
                            filmmaking.
                            <br> <br>
                            Moreover, it is easy to see that movies, TV shows and other forms of art talk more and more
                            about women
                            realities, letting the <a

                                male-gaze</a> in the past. However, like any great story, this
                            one
                            too has its
                            conflicts. Stereotypes and inequalities stubbornly persist in the industry, reminding us
                            that
                            our quest for
                            true equality is not over.</br>
                            <br>Let's embark on a journey of discovery together. In this study, we'll delve into the
                            gendered dynamics
                            at play in the film industry. Our guide? The CMU Movie Corpus dataset, a dataset of
                            thousands of
                            movies released between in the 20th and 21st centuries. To start, let us show you a first
                            insight on the
                            cleaned dataset
                            we are working with, look at the graph below which tracks the evolution of the 9,146 movie
                            releases
                            through the years.</br>

                            <iframe src="plots/movie_distribution.html" width="100%" height="600"
                                style="border:none;"></iframe>
                            <br>See? There are very few movies before 1980, this is why for the visual simplicity of
                            future
                            graphs which represent values per year, we will restrain the years range to the 30 years
                            between
                            1980 and 2010 only.</br>

                            <br>Transitioning from our temporal exploration of movie releases to the geographical
                            dimension,
                            we uncover another layer of the film industry's story. Let's pivot our focus to the global
                            map,
                            where the geographical origins of these movies paint a vivid picture of industry trends and
                            cultural
                            dominance.</br>

                            <iframe src="plots/map_countries_number_of_distinct_movies.html" width="100%" height="600"
                                style="border:none;"></iframe>

                            <br>The map we showed highlights a clear bias: a vast majority of the movies between
                            1980-2010 originate
                            from the United States and Europe. This concentration indicates a Western-centric dominance
                            in the
                            film industry, both in terms of quantity and cultural influence, or more likely a bias in our dataset.
                            This geographical bias in our dataset, evident in the distribution of movie production, is a
                            crucial factor
                            to bear in mind as we proceed with our future analyses, ensuring a nuanced understanding
                            of the film industry's landscape.</br>

                            <br>First, we could ask ourselves the following question: "Are there more women actresses
                            who
                            play
                            characters in movies now than before?"</br>
                            <iframe src="plots/actors_gender_proportion.html" width="100%" height="600"
                                style="border:none;"></iframe>
                            <br>That is interesting! From 1980 to 2010, the proportion of women actresses compared to
                            men
                            increased of a few percents! It is not a huge increase, but it still is considerable.
                            We'll have to investigate more on that and the potential causes for this increase, as well
                            as
                            whether when
                            women are <b>more</b> represented, it also imply they are <b>better</b> represented or
                            not.</br><br /><br />

                            <h3 class="tm-text-primary mb-4 tm-section-title">Part I : What influence the presence of
                                actress ?</h3>
                            <br>In our journey to understand the role of women in the film industry, we first delve into
                            the proportion
                            of female actresses in movies. This exploration is only based on the data we have, without
                            of correlating
                            changes in the industry with broader historical events.
                            A natural question arises: how do the roles of movie directors and producers influence this
                            proportion?
                            To answer this, let's look at the gender breakdown among these influential figures.
                            <br>
                            <iframe src="plots/gender_distribution_bar.html" width="100%" height="600"
                                style="border:none;"></iframe>
                            <br>
                            Observing the surprisingly low proportion of female directors, even more so than producers,
                            prompts us to examine how these figures have evolved over the years.
                            <br>
                            <iframe src="plots/director_gender_proportion.html" width="100%" height="600"
                                style="border:none;"></iframe>
                            <br>
                            Interestingly, the proportion of female directors has remained relatively constant, showing
                            minimal change over time. But what about the producers?
                            <br>
                            <iframe src="plots/producer_gender_proportion.html" width="100%" height="600"
                                style="border:none;"></iframe>
                            <br>
                            Similarly, the trend for female producers mirrors that of directors — consistent but modest
                            representation. This leads us to an intriguing aspect: is there a correlation between the
                            presence of female directors and producers and the proportion of female actresses?
                            <br>
                            <iframe src="plots/director_producer_actor_gender_correlation.html" width="100%"
                                height="550" style="border:none;"></iframe>
                            <br>
                            Against the backdrop of these low proportions, we find a silver lining. There appears to be
                            a <b>positive correlation between the proportion of actresses and the involvement of female
                                directors or producers</b>. Notably, when both the director and producer are women, the
                            proportion of actresses tends to be even higher. Statistical t-tests confirm this
                            correlation, revealing significant \(p\)-values of \(10^{-4}\) for female producers,
                            \(1.76\times10{-23}\) for female directors, and \(2.66\times10{-15}\) when both roles are
                            occupied by women.

                            But there's more to the story. How does this representation vary across different movie
                            genres?
                            <br>
                            <br>

                            <h3>Movie Genres and Gender Distribution</h3>
                            <iframe src="plots/bd_genre_ds.html" width="100%" height="600"
                                style="border:none;"></iframe>
                            <br>
                            The plot above reveals significant variations in gender distribution across movie genres.
                            Actresses are more prominent in genres like LGBT, Drama, and Romance,
                            while they are less represented in Action or Crime movies.<br /><br />

                            The insights gained from our analysis paint a multifaceted picture of women's
                            representation in movies. While female directors and producers are few,
                            their presence correlates with a higher proportion of female actors. This correlation
                            is further nuanced by the genre of the movie, <b>indicating that the battle for
                                gender balance in the film industry is influenced by various factors</b>, including the
                            type
                            of movies being made. As we continue to advocate for more balanced and diverse
                            representation in
                            cinema, these findings underscore the importance of female leadership in shaping the
                            narrative and presence of women on screen.
                            <br /><br /><br />

                            <h2 class="tm-text-primary mb-4 tm-section-title">Part II : Representation matters but is it
                                enough ?</h2>
                            Now is time to evaluate the quality of the representation of women in the film
                            industry!<br /><br />
                            <h3>Actors age</h3>
                            First, we will look at the evolution of the age of male and female actors. Why? Simply
                            because
                            young women are generally prefered than old women, while we are supposed to appreciate men
                            at
                            every age.<br />


                            <iframe src="plots/age_evolution_plot.html" width="100%" height="600"
                                style="border:none;"></iframe>

                            Well well well... The median age of male actors remains higher than that of female actors
                            throughout the observed period, reflecting a persistent age gap.
                            This trend could be indicative of industry preferences or casting practices that tend to
                            favor different age profiles for male and female roles.
                            While <b>actress are casted at the age of around 30 while the median for actors is 40</b>.
                            This does set very different standards contributing to the stereotype that age has more
                            negatives consequences
                            for the evaluation of women compared to men.<br /><br /><br />

                            As we analyse the distribution of actress in movies we should also take a deep dive into
                            what they play. As this may be very well contribute to stereotypes on screen. <br />
                            We scraped the role played by thousands of actors in movies and classified their role into
                            several categories. This helps us understand what kind of character they play.<br />
                            <br />
                            Actors are credited in movies as several categories.<br />
                            Some roles have names in the scenario, some only have job duties.<br />

                            <div class="image" style="width: 100%;">
                                <img style="max-width: 100%; height: auto; display:block" src="plots/role_cat.png"

                            We translate theses categories to four level of importance, with more important characters
                            having names
                            and less charachter only being in a relationship with a named character or worse, with an
                            unnamed character.
                            <br />
                            How does gender impact these different categories ?<br />

                            <iframe src="plots/bar_plt_role_cat.html" width="100%" height="600"
                                style="border:none;"></iframe>

                            Let's have a look at the roles credited as a job! We do see that <b>overwelming majority of
                                roles are played by
                                actors for the two first categories</b>. However, we observe that it's not the case for
                            roles that are
                            <b>further away from the main characters have a higher number of actress</b>.
                            Let's look at what all of these roles are!
                            <br />
                            Our first question is: What's the most common jobs played by actors and actresses?<br />

                            <iframe src="plots/job_roles_bar.html" width="100%" height="600"
                                style="border:none;"></iframe>


                            We find some roles which describe their position in the family.
                            Theses roles were not classified by our NLP as supporting role to a named
                            character as they may simply be label as "The grandmother" and not "Ted's grandmother".

                            We observe that for the roles that are not describing their position in the family,
                            actress have roles such as <b>nurse, waitress, receptionist...</b> while men seem to have
                            higher status roles such as <b>doctors, cops/sheriff, owner, reporter, priest...</b>

                            Let's take a closer look at who plays nurses and doctors.

                            <iframe src="plots/job_comparison_nurse_doctor.html" width="100%" height="600"
                                style="border:none;"></iframe>

                            So doctors are overwhelmingly played by men while nurses are mostly
                            played by women. How does it compare to reality ?
                            Let's compare it to the 2008 U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics.
                            In the statistics, <b>68% of doctors are men</b>, compared to <b>82% of unnamed doctors
                                character's in movies</b>. While for nurse, <b>90% of registered nurses are women</b>,
                            in movies it's <b>72%</b>. <br />

                            <br />

                            So, while not a perfectly identical to the gender gap in our society, we find a <b>heavy
                                bias in
                                how the roles are casted</b>. Let's check if this is evolving through time: <br />
                            <iframe src="plots/role_job_barplot_history_doctor.html" width="100%" height="600"
                                style="border:none;"></iframe>

                            <iframe src="plots/role_job_barplot_history_nurse.html" width="100%" height="600"
                                style="border:none;"></iframe>

                            While we do see that movies in 2010s seem to completely differ from the other decades,
                            this first look at the data seems to indicate less bias in recent years.
                            Let's check how other professions are doing.
                            Especially who plays jobs with a perceived higher social status ?<br />

                            <iframe src="plots/job_comparison_several.html" width="100%" height="600"
                                style="border:none;"></iframe>
                            <br />
                            For instance: looking at the gender distribution of teachers and professors.
                            One job title: <b>professor is linked to higher education and seems to be a role heavily
                                played by men</b>,
                            while the other: <b>teacher is played by both actor and actresses</b>.

                            For a few of the jobs listed in the most common roles, we find that most of them are heavily
                            gendered.
                            <br> <br>
                            As we have a small number of roles played for each job, we will attempt to have a look at
                            the bigger picture.
                            Let's agregate some data using a useful metric.<br />
                            If women play roles of jobs with a lower social status, what does their <b>fictional average
                                salary</b> would look like?
                            We used the data from the May 2022 National Occupational Employment and
                            Wage Estimates to estimate the average salary of the jobs played by actors and actresses.
                            <br />
                            <br />

                            <iframe src="plots/box_plot_role_avg_pay.html" width="100%" height="600"
                                style="border:none;"></iframe>
                            First thing we observe in the above distributions is an almost <b>identical median for both
                                genders</b>!
                            But we do observe some differences, as we can see that <b>low-wages jobs are
                                mostly acted by women while actors are casted to high paying jobs</b>.
                            We also find what we could call a glass ceiling as the maximum salary for jobs
                            played by actress corresponds to the upper quartile of the men's job.
                            <br />
                            We will now take a peak at the 10 most played supporting role,
                            credited in a relationship to a named character.<br />

                            <iframe src="plots/r2n_roles_bar.html" width="100%" height="600"
                                style="border:none;"></iframe>

                            We see similar roles, unsurprisingly, most of them are family members to a named character
                            but for the roles that are not, we notice again that
                            they include lawyer and doctor for actor's role and secretary for the women's role... <br />
                            So again, it's the same story here ! <br /> <br />

                            We will not look at the supporting roles credited as in a relationship with a person
                            characterized by their job, as they represent too few examples.<br /> <br />

                            So, what did we find ? <br />
                            In summary, the contrast in the roles given to actors and actresses reflect common gender
                            stereotypes in storytelling and media,
                            where <b>men are often associated with higher social status jobs, power, authority and
                                action,</b>
                            while <b>women are often portrayed as a relationship or play highly gendered jobs</b> in
                            their roles.
                            <br />
                            This is a useful piece of the puzzle on how stereotypes are conveyed in movies productions.

                            <br /><br /><br />

                                    Have you ever heard of the Bechdel Test? It's a set of criteria that a film must
                                    meet
                                    to be
                                    considered minimally adequate in representing women.<br />
                                    Popularized by Alison
                                    Bechdel
                                    back in 1985 (the original
                                    illustration is shown on the right),
                                    the test is incredibly simple: <br /><br />

                                    <ol>
                                        <li>There must be at least two named women in the film;</li>
                                        <li>They must talk to each other;</li>
                                        <li>About something other than a man.</li>
                                    </ol>

                                    Sounds easy, right? In an ideal world, every film would effortlessly pass this
                                    test.
                                    Yet, the
                                    reality is a bit more complex...<br /><br />

                                    We've managed to gather Bechdel Score data for 2,658 films, thanks to the API
                                    from
                                    the <a href="https://bechdeltest.com/">Bechdel Test website</a>. It is important
                                    to
                                    note
                                    that anyone can enter data on whether a film passes the Bechdel Test or not, on
                                    a
                                    scale to 0 to 3.
                                    The lingering question remains: Has the Bechdel Test influenced the
                                    audience's
                                    perception and the representation of women in the film industry?

                                Imagine how different the cinematic landscape could be if more films met these criteria.
                                What do
                                you think? Do films that pass the Bechdel Test tend to resonate more with audiences, or
                                is
                                the
                                impact more subtle, perhaps reflected in the gradual evolution of female roles in
                                cinema?
                                Let's
                                delve into this intriguing topic together.</p>

                            But first, an important consideration: we need to be cautious with those data, because not
                            all movies from the CMU Dataset
                            have
                            been evaluated by the Bechdel test (only between 20 and 140 per year between 1980 and 2010).
                            We should also consider that there is a bias on the set
                            of movies that were entered by hand in this Bechdel dataset and also add that, while the
                            Bechdel test can be a useful initial indicator of female
                            presence in films, it is not a comprehensive measure of a film's portrayal of
                            women.<br /><br />
                            So let's start this analysis,
                            by looking at the evolution
                            of the proportion of movies that passed the test:<br />
                            <!--<iframe src="plots/number_of_movies_bechdel.html" width="100%" height="600"
                                style="border:none;"></iframe>-->

                            <iframe src="plots/bd_rating_evolution.html" width="100%" height="600"
                                style="border:none;"></iframe>

                            There is quite an increase in the mean proportion of movies that pass the Bechdel test!
                            (slope is 0.005)<br />
                            Even though the proportion of movies that pass the test is still low, it is encouraging to
                            see it increase over time.<br />

                            Now, do you think that movies with higher Bechdel rating involve more women ? <br />

                            <iframe src="plots/actors_bdrating_proportion.html" width="100%" height="600"
                                style="border:none;"></iframe>

                            Here, it is obvious that a higher Bechdel rating typically indicates a greater percentage of
                            actresses (around 24% difference for movies which completely pass the Bechdel test compared
                            to the
                            ones
                            that do not), this is a result we could reasonabily have expected, considering the
                            test's inherent design. But still, let's not take any shortcut! It is not because women are
                            present that they have interesting roles nor their own plot.
                            So movies with higher number of actress tends
                            to have
                            a higher Bechdel rating.

                                Perspectives.</h2>

                            But then, let’s answer the question: <b>is it clickbait?</b> Does it contribute to the
                            popularity of the movie? Or even to the revenue? <br /><br />

                            Firstly, we'll take 2 metrics: the popularity of the movie, which is a score determined
                            here by <a href="https://developer.themoviedb.org/docs/popularity-and-trending">TMDB</a>,
                            and the rating of the movie.
                            <br />

                            <iframe src="plots/popularity.html" width="100%" height="600" style="border:none;"></iframe>
                            There's an intriguing pattern in these glitzy displays: movies that only score 1 at the
                            Bechdel test are often the most popular ones. Why is
                            this so? The answers aren't straightforward. This could be multiple confounder into this
                            complex
                            tapestry. It could be that the film
                            industry, with its influential might, chooses to shine a brighter spotlight on movies
                            where
                            male characters take the center stage, and where women only are... present.
                            Or perhaps, the audience, like a river, naturally flows towards the stories
                            echoing a significant male
                            presence. So is it the chicken or the egg?
                            Let's see if we can find any pattern between the percentage of actresses and the rating:
                            <br /><br />

                            <h3> A friend to the rescue: Matching</h3>

                            <br>
                            Let's do something new ! Have you ever heard about Matching ? It's a relatively new concept
                            in statistics,
                            popularized by Donald Rubin in the 1980s. You can think of Matching as your trusty sidekick
                            in reducing bias when estimating treatment effects in observational studies. Here's the
                            challenge: for every treated unit in your study, you need to find one or more non-treated
                            units. But not just any units will do. These counterparts must be similar in observable
                            characteristics, creating a perfect balance against which the covariates are evenly matched.
                            <br><br>
                            Here, we will perform exact one-to-one matching, based on the main genre of the movie.
                            By comparing movies within these genre-matched pairs, we hope to accurately assess the
                            impact of genre on both Bechdel Ratings and audience popularity. This controlled comparison
                            helps isolate the variable of genre, allowing for a clearer understanding of its role. We
                            will have two groups
                            <br>
                            <br>

                            <ul>
                                <li>
                                    <b>Treatment Group</b>: Movies from a genre that typically scores high on the
                                    Bechdel
                                    test.
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                    <b>Control Group</b>: Movies from a genre that typically scores low on the Bechdel
                                    test.
                                </li>
                            </ul>

                            Doing this on our dataset, we get 880 pairs of matched movies! Let's see what we can learn
                            from
                            this.
                            We want to know if the Bechdel rating plays a role in the popularity of a movie. So, let's
                            try
                            to estimate the following linear regression <code
                                style="color: crimson;">popularity ~ bechdel_rating</code>. We obtain that <br>

                            <p><span class="math display">\[\texttt{popularity} = \beta_0 + \beta_1 \times
                                    \texttt{bechdel_rating} = 9.4 - 0.1140 \times \texttt{bechdel_rating}\]</span></p>

                            It seems that the Bechdel rating and the popularity are <i>negatively</i> correlated.
                            Interesting, isn't it ? In fact... not really. What is important to mention is also the
                            \(p\)-value of these coefficients. It turns out that
                            the \(p\)-value of the \(\texttt{bechdel_rating}\) is \(0.450\), which means that the value
                            of
                            \(\beta_1\)
                            is <b>not</b>
                            statistically significant. Therefore, we can not state that the Bechdel rating
                            impacts a movie's
                            popularity,
                            and as a result, producers should not have any reason to be concerned with it. <br>
                            </p>

                            <p>
                                Let's now look at the correlation directly between the Bechdel rating and the
                                popularity,
                                the box-office revenue and the vote average.
                            </p>

                            <div style="display: flex; justify-content: center; align-items: center; height: 100%;">

                            </div><br />

                            The heatmap on the right is showcasing the \(p\)-values linked with correlation
                            coefficients from the left heatmap. All these values are between \(0.00\) and \(0.05\).
                            This
                            tiny
                            detail is crucial. The patterns you see on the left
                            heatmap aren't mere coincidences. They're statistically significant!
                            <br><br>
                            Let's focus back on the left heatmap. Here, the coefficients are quantified on a scale
                            from
                            -1 to 1. Imagine this scale as a spectrum. At one end, -1 signals a perfectly inverse
                            correlation, like two dancers moving in opposite directions. At the other end, 1
                            suggests a
                            perfectly direct correlation, akin to synchronized swimmers moving in harmony. And in
                            the
                            middle, 0 stands for no correlation, like independent artists painting in their own
                            styles.
                            <br><br>
                            Now, here's the twist. Despite the beautiful array of data, <b>the correlations are
                                generally weak.</b> This subtly hints that the Bechdel test ratings have a minimal
                            direct impact on a
                            movie’s financial success at the box office and its acceptance by the general public.
                            <br><br>
                            This means that producers and film directors allow themselves to not adhere to the
                            Bechdel test as it does not influence them in any way, which would give no monetary benefits
                            to make movies that pass the Bechdel test or even reducde difference in
                            proportion between actresses and actors.

                            <p>
                                During all this analysis, we used an open source dataset without putting an emphasis on the ethical and moral responsibilities. 
                                Now, we need
                                to navigate the complex ethical questions raised in our analysis with four guiding "ethical
                                lenses": beneficence, non-maleficence, privacy, and fairness.
                                <br><br>
                                As we saw, our insights could
                                potentially reshape how producers and directors approach actor recruitment. 

                                But this needs to be done carefully. Consider the
                                Bechdel test – while its impact might seem limited, overlooking it could encourage sexist
                                behaviors in the industry.
                                <br><br>

                                Now, turn to privacy. We're handling sensitive data, laden with personal details of
                                actors. How do we protect their identities? The solution could lie in sophisticated
                                techniques like \(k\)-anonymity or \(\epsilon\)-differential privacy, ensuring insights without invasion.
                                <br><br>

                                Finally, the lens of fairness invites you to ponder deeper. Our data analysis holds
                                power – the power to influence perceptions and decisions. It's crucial to wield this
                                power judiciously, ensuring our conclusions don't perpetuate discrimination, especially
                                against women in the industry.

                            So what did we learn?<br /><br />
                            First and foremost, it’s not tomorrow that we will achieve gender equality in the acting world.
                            <b>We are far from a 50/50 ratio, and it may take decades.</b><br /><br />
                            We did observe that the proportion of actors/actresses in a movie was correlated with the
                            gender of the director and the producer. <b>This may be a good lead in order to fast track
                                gender equality in the industry.</b> <br /><br />
                            The deep analysis of the roles assigned to the characters allowed us to see that <b>men and
                                women generally play stereotypical roles</b>. This does tell us that casting more actress is not
                            enough! <b>We need better roles in order not to reproduce patriarchal
                                stereotypes.</b><br /><br />
                            We also saw that the Bechdel test give us something to look forward to, as <b>movies seem to
                                be passing increasingly!</b><br /><br />
                            Finally, we check how the audience felt about movies that passed or failed the Bechdel test
                            and <b> we did not find that more “feminist” movies are unpopular.</b><br /><br />
                            We hope that this analysis gave a first glimpse of the gendered dynamics at play in the film
                            industry, and that it will encourage you to watch movies with a more critical
                            eye.<br /><br />
