                            </h2>
                            Through the feminist struggles and the recent advances in gender equality, women have gained
                            space and
                            importance in movies.
                            <br>Indeed, the cinematic world has long been a mirror reflecting societal norms and
                            changes,
                            and nowhere is
                            this more evident than in the representation of women.</br>
                            <br> In the hallowed halls of the <a
                                href="https://www.festival-cannes.com/selection/">Cannes
                                Film
                                Festival</a>, a prestigious battleground for cinematic
                            excellence, the winds of change are palpable. This year, a striking 7 out of 21 films
                            competing
                            for the top
                            prize are helmed by women (1/3). Cast your mind back to 1995, and the contrast is stark: a mere 2
                            out
                            of 24 (1/12). This
                            shift is more than just numbers; it's a testament to the slow but sure march towards gender
                            parity in
                            filmmaking.
                            <br> <br>
                            Moreover, it is easy to see that movies, TV shows and other forms of art talk more and more
                            about women
                            realities, letting the archaic male-gaze in the past. However, like any great story, this
                            one
                            too has its
                            conflicts. Stereotypes and inequalities stubbornly persist in the industry, reminding us
                            that
                            our quest for
                            true equality is not over.</br>
                            <br>Let's embark on a journey of discovery together. In this study, we'll delve into the
                            gendered dynamics
                            at play in the film industry. Our guide? The CMU Movie Corpus dataset, a dataset of
                            thousands of
                            movies released between in the 20th and 21st centuries. To start, let us show you a first insight on the
                            cleaned dataset
                            we are working with, look at the graph below which tracks the evolution of the 9'146 movie releases
                            through the years.</br>

                            <iframe src="plots/movie_distribution.html" width="100%" height="600"
                                style="border:none;"></iframe>
                            <br>See? There are very few movies before 1980, this is why for the visual simplicity of
                            future
                            graphs which represent values per year, we will restrain the years range to the 30 years
                            between
                            1980 and 2010 only.</br>

                            <br>Transitioning from our temporal exploration of movie releases to the geographical dimension, 
                            we uncover another layer of the film industry's story. Let's pivot our focus to the global map, 
                            where the geographical origins of these movies paint a vivid picture of industry trends and cultural 
                            dominance.</br>
                            
                            <iframe src="plots/map_countries_number_of_distinct_movies.html" width="100%" height="600"
                                style="border:none;"></iframe>

                            <br>The map we showed highlights a clear bias: a vast majority of the movies between 1980-2010 originate 
                            from the United States and Europe. This concentration indicates a Western-centric dominance in the 
                            film industry, both in terms of quantity and cultural influence. 
                            This geographical bias in our dataset, evident in the distribution of movie production, is a crucial factor 
                            to bear in mind as we proceed with our future analyses, ensuring a comprehensive and nuanced understanding 
                            of the film industry's landscape.</br>
                            
                            <br>First, we could ask ourselves the following question: "Are there more women actresses
                            who
                            play
                            characters in movies now than before?"</br>
                            <iframe src="plots/actors_gender_proportion.html" width="100%" height="600"
                                style="border:none;"></iframe>
                            <br>That is interesting! From 1980 to 2010, the proportion of women actresses compared to
                            men
                            increased ! It is not a huge increase, but it still is considerable.
                            We'll have to investigate more on that and the potential causes for this increase, as well
                            as
                            whether when
                            women are <b>more</b> represented, it also imply they are <b>better</b> represented or
                            not.</br>

                                women proportion playing in movies TEST</h2>
                            Now, let us explore the potential causes for the proportion of women actresses in movies.
                            Here, we
                            will only take the data on the movies we have access to.
                            We will not be correlating the growing number of actresses to historical events
                            whatsoever.<br />
                            The first thing that should come into your mind is: "What about the movie directors and
                            producers?" Lucky you, the next graphs are about the gender proportions of the latter.<br />
                            <iframe src="plots/gender_distribution_bar.html" width="100%" height="600"
                                style="border:none;"></iframe>
                            <br />
                            It is quite crazy to see such a low propotion of female directors, it is even lower than the
                            percentage
                            of producers! So let's see how this proportion evolved through the years.<br />

                            <iframe src="plots/director_gender_proportion.html" width="100%" height="600"
                                style="border:none;"></iframe>
                            <br />
                            It looks like it almost did not change at all! But what about the producers?<br />

                            <iframe src="plots/producer_gender_proportion.html" width="100%" height="600"
                                style="border:none;"></iframe>
                            <br />
                            Well well well, we should have kept our excpectations low, because it is the same story
                            here!
                            So let's see if, despite the small number of directors and producers, there is a correlation
                            with the proportion of actresses.<br />

                            <iframe src="plots/director_producer_actor_gender_correlation.html" width="100%"
                                height="550" style="border:none;"></iframe>
                            Despite the last sad discoveries, here it seems like there is a correlation between the
                            proportion of actresses and the involvement
                            of a female director or a female producer. When both director and producer are women, it
                            seems
                            like the proportion of actresses is even higher. Indeed, applying the statistical t-test over
                            the correlation with the proportion of actresses, we obtain a p-value of 10<sup>-4</sup> for a female 
                            producer, 1.76·10<sup>-23</sup> for a female director and 2.66·10<sup>-15</sup> for both female director and producer.
                            We conclude that there is a correlation between the proportion of actresses in a movie and
                            the gender of the director and/or the producer. <br />

                            But wait, there's another twist in the tale. What about the distribution of actors and actresses 
                            depending on the movie genres? Here we plotted the first 15 most popular genres, and the proportion of
                            actors and actresses in each of them. <br />
                        </p><br />

                        <h3>Movie Genres</h3>
                        <iframe src="plots/bd_genre_ds.html" width="100%" height="600"
                            style="border:none;"></iframe>

                            As you can see, the distribution of male and female actors varies significantly across
                            movie
                            genres. Female
                            actors are more frequently seen in LGBT, Drama, and Romance films, whereas they are less
                            prevalent in Action or Crime movies.
                            But now, let's dive into the most interesting part of this study: the analysis of the quality
                            of the representation of women in movies.<br /><br /><br />

                            <h2 class="tm-text-primary mb-4 tm-section-title">Quality of women representation</h2>
                            Now is time to evaluate the quality of this encouraging involvement of women in the film
                            industry!<br /><br />
                            <h3>Actors age</h3>
                            First, we will look at the evolution of the age of male and female actors. Why? Simply
                            because
                            young women are generally prefered than old women, while we are supposed to appreciate men
                            at
                            every age.<br />


                            <iframe src="plots/age_evolution_plot.html" width="100%" height="600"
                                style="border:none;"></iframe>
                            Well well well... It seems pretty clear that there is no evolution among the years, but that
                            the
                            difference between genders stays tremendously stable!<br /><br /><br />

                            <h3>Actors roles</h3>
                            Then, we will look at the roles of the actors.<br />
                            Actors are credited in movies as several categories.<br />
                            Some roles have names in the scenario, some only have job duties. 
                            <div class="image" style="width: 90%;">
                                <img style="max-width: 100%; height: auto; display:block"
                                    src="plots/role_cat.png" alt="Role categories">
                            </div>
                            (Pictogram credit: <a href="https://thenounproject.com/browse/collection-icon/characters-49091/?p=1">Dando</a>)
                            <br />

                            We translate theses categories to four level of importance, with more important characters having names 
                            and less charachter only being in a relationship with a named character or worse, with an unnamed character.
                            <br />
                            How does gender impact these different categories ?
                            <iframe src="plots/bar_plt_role_cat.html" width="100%" height="600"
                                style="border:none;"></iframe>
                            
                            Let's have a look at the roles credited as a job! We do see that overwelming majority of roles are played by
                            actors for the two first categories. We however observe that it's not the case for roles that are of less importance,
                            we see a higher number of actress. Let's look at what all of these roles are!
                            The first question is: What most common jobs do actors play ?<br />
                            
                            <iframe src="plots/job_roles_bar.html" width="100%" height="600"
                                style="border:none;"></iframe>


                                We find some roles which describe their position in the family. 
                                Theses roles were not classified by our NLP as supporting role to a named 
                                character as they may simply be label as "The grandmother" and not "Ted's grandmother".

                                We observe that for the roles that are not describing their position in the family, 
                                actress have roles such as nurse, waitress, receptionist... while men seem to have 
                                higher status roles such as doctors, cops/sheriff, owner, reporter, priest...

                                Let's take another look at the gender distribution in those roles. Are jobs with a
                                perceived higher social status played by actors ?

                                We can compare the gender of the roles of doctors with nurses in the last decades.
                            
                                So doctors are overwhelmingly played by men while nurse are mostly 
                                played by women. How does it compare to reality ?
                                Let's compare it to the 2008 U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics. 
                                In the statistics, 68% of doctors are men, compared to 82% of unnamed doctors 
                                character's in movies. While for nurse, 90% of registered nurses are women, 
                                in movies it's 72%. <br />
                                (Source:

                                So, while not a perfectly identical to the gender gap in our society, we find a heavy bias in 
                                how the roles are casted. Let's check if this is evolving through time: <br />

                                While we do see that movies in 2010s seem to completely differ from the other year, 
                                this first look at the data seems to indicate less bias in recent years. Let's check another professions:<br />
                                For the role driver, the actors are 0.81 men, 0.03 women and 0.16 unknown. Number of roles 68.<br />
                                For the role judge, the actors are 0.78 men, 0.11 women and 0.11 unknown. Number of roles 37.<br />
                                For the role reporter, the actors are 0.52 men, 0.28 women and 0.21 unknown. Number of roles 29.<br />
                                For the role prosecutor, the actors are 0.71 men, 0.14 women and 0.14 unknown. Number of roles 7.<br />
                                For the role teacher, the actors are 0.44 men, 0.36 women and 0.2 unknown. Number of roles 25.<br />
                                For the role professor, the actors are 0.78 men, 0.11 women and 0.11 unknown. Number of roles 9.<br />
                                For the role cop, the actors are 0.81 men, 0.03 women and 0.16 unknown. Number of roles 31.<br />
                                For the role receptionist, the actors are 0.22 men, 0.5 women and 0.28 unknown. Number of roles 18.<br />
                                For the role owner, the actors are 0.7 men, 0.13 women and 0.17 unknown. Number of roles 23.<br />
                                For the role waiter-waitress, the actors are 0.57 men, 0.43 women. Number of roles 54. <br /><br />
                                For a few of the jobs listed in the most common roles, we find that most of them are heavily gendered.
                                <br />
                                For example: looking at the gender distribution of teachers and professors. 
                                One title: professor is linked to higher education and seems to be a role heavily played by men, 
                                while the other: teacher is played by both actor and actresses.                                

                                For a few of the jobs listed in the most common roles, we find that most of them are heavily gendered.
                                <br />
                                As we have a small number of roles played for each job, we will attempt to have a look at the bigger picture.
                                Let's agregate some data using a useful metric.<br />
                                If women play roles of jobs with a lower social status, what does their fictional average salary would look like?
                                We used the data from the May 2022 National Occupational Employment and 
                                Wage Estimates to estimate the average salary of the jobs played by actors and actresses.
                                <br />

                                style="border:none;"></iframe>
                                We observe an almost identical median ! 
                                But we do observe some differences, as we can see that low-wages jobs are 
                                mostly acted by women while actors are casted to high paying jobs.
                                We also very find a glass ceiling as the maximum salary for jobs 
                                played by actress corresponds to the upper quartile of the men's job.
                                <br />
                                We will now take a peak at the 10 most played supporting role, 
                                credited in a relationship to a named character.<br />

                            <iframe src="plots/r2n_roles_bar.html" width="100%" height="600"
                            style="border:none;"></iframe>

                            We see similar roles, unsurprisingly, most of them are family members with 
                            a named character but for the roles that are not, we notice again that 
                            they include lawyer and doctor for actor's role and secretary for the women's role...
                            
                            We will not look at the supporting roles credited as in a relationship with a person 
                            characterized by their job, as they represent too few examples.

                            So, what did we find ? In summary, the contrast in the roles given to actors and actresses reflect common gender stereotypes in storytelling and media, where men are often associated with higher social status jobs, power, authority and action, while women are often portrayed in relation to helpful and emotional roles, when they are not their personal assistant.
                            <br />
                            This is a useful piece of the puzzle on how stereotypes are conveyed in movies productions.

                                    <p>Have you ever heard of the Bechdel Test? It's a set of criteria that a film must
                                        meet
                                        to be
                                        considered minimally adequate in representing women. Popularized by Alison
                                        Bechdel
                                        back in 1985 (the original
                                        illustration is shown on the right),
                                        the test is incredibly simple:</p>

                                    <ol>
                                        <li>There must be at least two named women in the film;</li>
                                        <li>They must talk to each other;</li>
                                        <li>About something other than a man.</li>
                                    </ol>

                                    <p>Sounds easy, right? In an ideal world, every film would effortlessly pass this
                                        test.
                                        Yet, the
                                        reality is a bit more complex...</p>

                                    <p>We've managed to gather Bechdel Score data for 2,658 films, thanks to the API
                                        from
                                        the <a href="https://bechdeltest.com/">Bechdel Test website</a>. It is important
                                        to
                                        note
                                        that anyone can enter data on whether a film passes the Bechdel Test or not, on
                                        a
                                        scale to 0 to 3.
                                        The lingering question remains: Has the Bechdel Test influenced the
                                        audience's
                                        perception and the representation of women in the film industry?</p>

                                Imagine how different the cinematic landscape could be if more films met these criteria.
                                What do
                                you think? Do films that pass the Bechdel Test tend to resonate more with audiences, or
                                is
                                the
                                impact more subtle, perhaps reflected in the gradual evolution of female roles in
                                cinema?
                                Let's
                                delve into this intriguing topic together.</p>

                            However, we need to be careful with those data, because not all movies from the CMU Dataset
                            have
                            been evaluated by the Bechdel test. We should also consider that there is a bias on the set
                            of
                            movies that were entered by hand in this Bechdel dataset.<br />
                            <iframe src="plots/number_of_movies_bechdel.html" width="100%" height="600"
                                style="border:none;"></iframe>

                            <iframe src="plots/bd_rating_evolution.html" width="100%" height="600"
                                style="border:none;"></iframe>

                            As one can see, only between 16 and 140 movies were evaluated per year, which is a very
                            small
                            number compared to the total number of movies released per year (between 1980 and 2010).
                            Let's
                            start this analysis, by looking at the evolution of the Bechdel rating through the
                            years.<br />

                            Now, do you think that movies with higher Bechdel rating involve more women ? <br />

                            <iframe src="plots/actors_bdrating_proportion.html" width="100%" height="600"
                                style="border:none;"></iframe>

                            <p>
                                It is obvious that a higher Bechdel rating typically indicates a greater representation
                                of
                                women (>20% increase for movies which completely pass the Bechdel test compared to the
                                ones
                                that do not), this is a result we could reasonabily have expected, considering the
                                test's
                                inherent design. So movies with higher number of actress tends
                                to have
                                a higher Bechdel rating. But does this better rating influences the impact on the
                                audience?
                                Here, we'll take 2 metrics: the popularity of the movie, and the rating of the movie.
                            </p>


                            <iframe src="plots/popularity.html" width="100%" height="600" style="border:none;"></iframe>

                            <p>
                                There's an intriguing pattern in these glitzy displays: movies that only score 1 at the
                                Bechdel test are often the most popular onesy. Why is
                                this so? The answers aren't straightforward. This could be multiple confounder into this
                                complex
                                tapestry. It could be that the film
                                industry, with its influential might, chooses to shine a brighter spotlight on movies
                                where
                                male characters take the center stage, and where women only are... present.
                                Or perhaps, the audience, like a river, naturally flows towards the stories
                                echoing a significant male
                                presence. So is it the chicken or the egg?
                                Let's see if we can find any pattern between the percentage of actresses and the rating:
                            </p>


                            <p>
                                The biggest correlation among the ones we covered is the correlation between the
                                popularity
                                and the box-office revenue, which is quite an obvious correlation: the more people like
                                the
                                movie, the more they pay and go to the cinema to watch it! The Bechdel rating, however,
                                does not show great correlation, but in general, the higher the Bechdel rating, the
                                lower
                                the
                                box-office revenue, the popularity and the vote average.<br /><br />

                            <h3> A friend to the rescue: Matching</h3>

                            <br>
                            Have you ever heard about Matching ? It's a relatively new concept in statistics,
                            popularized by Donald Rubin in the 1980s. You can think of Matching as your trusty sidekick
                            in reducing bias when estimating treatment effects in observational studies. Here's the
                            challenge: for every treated unit in your study, you need to find one or more non-treated
                            units. But not just any units will do. These counterparts must be similar in observable
                            characteristics, creating a perfect balance against which the covariates are evenly matched.
                            <br><br>
                            Here, we will perform exact one-to-one matching, based on the main genre of the movie.
                            By comparing movies within these genre-matched pairs, we can more accurately assess the
                            impact of genre on both Bechdel Ratings and audience popularity. This controlled comparison
                            helps isolate the variable of genre, allowing for a clearer understanding of its role. We
                            will have two groups
                            <br>
                            <br>

                            <ul>
                                <li>
                                    <b>Treatment Group</b>: Movies from a genre that typically scores high on the
                                    Bechdel
                                    test.
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                    <b>Control Group</b>: Movies from a genre that typically scores low on the Bechdel
                                    test.
                                </li>
                            </ul>

                            Doing this on our dataset, we get 880 pairs of matched movies! Let's see what we can learn
                            from
                            this.
                            We want to know if the Bechdel rating plays a role in the popularity of a movie. So, let's
                            try
                            to estimate the following linear regression <code
                                style="color: crimson;">popularity ~ bechdel_rating</code>. We obtain that <br>

                            <p><span class="math display">\[\texttt{popularity} = \beta_0 + \beta_1 \times
                                    \texttt{bechdel_rating} = 9.4 - 0.1140 \times \texttt{bechdel_rating}\]</span></p>

                            It seems that the Bechdel rating and the popularity are <i>negatively</i> correlated.
                            Interesting, isn't it ? In fact... not really. What is important to mention is also the
                            \(p\)-value of these coefficients. It turns out that
                            the \(p\)-value of the \(\texttt{bechdel_rating}\) is \(0.450\), which means that the value
                            of
                            \(\beta_1\)
                            is <b>not</b>
                            statistically significant. The Bechdel rating, therefore, does not impact a movie's
                            popularity,
                            and as a result, producers are not concerned with it. <br>
                            </p>

                            <p>
                                Let's now look at the correlation directly between the Bechdel rating and the
                                popularity,
                                the box-office revenue and the vote average.
                            </p>

                                The heatmap on the right is showcasing the \(p\)-values linked with correlation
                                coefficients from the left heatmap. All these values are between \(0.00\) and \(0.05\).
                                This
                                tiny
                                detail is crucial. The patterns you see on the left
                                heatmap aren't mere coincidences. They're statistically significant!
                                <br><br>
                                Let's focus back on the left heatmap. Here, the coefficients are quantified on a scale
                                from
                                -1 to 1. Imagine this scale as a spectrum. At one end, -1 signals a perfectly inverse
                                correlation, like two dancers moving in opposite directions. At the other end, 1
                                suggests a
                                perfectly direct correlation, akin to synchronized swimmers moving in harmony. And in
                                the
                                middle, 0 stands for no correlation, like independent artists painting in their own
                                styles.
                                <br><br>
                                Now, here's the twist. Despite the beautiful array of data, the correlations are
                                generally
                                weak. This subtly hints that the Bechdel test ratings have a minimal direct impact on a
                                movie’s financial success at the box office and
                                its acceptance by the general public.
                                <br><br>
                                This means that producers and film directors allow themselves to not adhere to the
                                Bechdel
                                test as it does not influence them in any way, which explains the difference in
                                proportion
                                between actresses and actors.
                                In conclusion, while the Bechdel test can be a useful initial indicator of female
                                presence in films, it is not a comprehensive measure of a film's portrayal of women.<br /><br /><br />

                            <h2 class="tm-text-primary mb-4 tm-section-title">Conclusion</h2>
                            Through the analysis we conducted, we saw that between 1980 and 2010, the proportion of
                            actresses, directors and producers stayed stable. We also saw that the proportion of actresses
                            in a movie was correlated with the gender of the director and the producer.
                            Thanks to the Bechdel test, we also saw that the proportion of actresses in a movie was correlated
                            with the score of the movie at the Bechdel test. However, we also saw that the Bechdel test
                            score was not correlated with the popularity of the movie, nor with the box-office revenue.<br />
                            Moreover, the deep analysis of the roles assigned to the characters allowed us to see that 
                            women generally are designated as familiy members while men often have jobs.
                            We hope that this analysis gave a first glimpse of the gendered dynamics at play in the film
                            industry, and that it will encourage you to watch movies with a more critical eye.
